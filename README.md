========

This git repo is used for the Puppet Users Group Demo:
http://www.slideshare.net/adamcrews/ive-installed-puppet-now-what

This repo is a final version of the repo, but the demo interactively
builds this environment.

The minecraft environment has not been merged into the production branch

The notes for running the demo are in DEMO.md
